        <p>
          An American Family Is Losing Everything Because the Government Won’t
          Let a Wife Come Home. Ilsia has lived in the U.S. for 27 years —
          nearly 20 of those years with me. She raised our
          <strong>NINE</strong> children, built a home, and held our family
          together through everything. One of our daughters now serves in the
          U.S. Navy. And yet, her mother — the woman who raised her, who gave
          everything to this country — is being kept out. Because of a wrongful
          immigration decision, our family is facing homelessness, trauma, and
          forced exile.

                  In 1998, Ilsia was a young woman facing extreme poverty and
                  danger in Central America. At just 18 years old, terrified and
                  vulnerable, she made a desperate choice — using a different
                  last name to avoid being sent back to a place where her safety
                  wasn't guaranteed. She followed guidance from others to
                  survive.
                  <strong>No immigration benefit was gained</strong>, and
                  <strong>case law confirms this is not fraud</strong>. But the
                  embassy ignored this and misapplied the law, punishing her for
                  surviving.

              <p>
                In 1998, Ilsia was a young woman facing extreme poverty and
                danger in Central America. With no safe options, she made a
                desperate choice — using a different last name to avoid being
                sent back to a place where her safety wasn't guaranteed.

              <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
                <strong>This wasn't fraud.</strong><br />
                <strong>It wasn't deception.</strong><br />
                <strong>It was a human instinct to survive.</strong>
              </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
                Decades later, the U.S. Embassy labeled her a liar, ignoring the
                fact that no immigration benefit was gained, no system was
                cheated, and no crime was committed.
              </p>

              <p>
                Ilsia was the glue that held our family together. Her sudden
                forced separation has left our nine children struggling
                emotionally and mentally. Teachers have noticed their
                frustration and sadness — quiet stares, emotional outbursts, and
                a visible loss of direction.<br /><br />
                Studies show that parental separation, especially from a primary
                caregiver, leads to long-term trauma, anxiety, and academic
                decline. This isn't an abstract theory — it's happening to our
                family right now.
              </p>

              >
                This is how families get destroyed. Every day of separation
                causes more damage that may never heal.
